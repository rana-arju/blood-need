    "questions": {
      "blood": {
        "types": {
          "question": "What are the different blood types?",
          "answer": "There are eight main blood types: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. These types are determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens on the surface of red blood cells, as well as the Rh factor (positive or negative)."
        },
        "compatibility": {
          "question": "Which blood types are compatible with each other?",
          "answer": "Blood type compatibility is crucial for transfusions. Type O- is the universal donor (can donate to any blood type), while AB+ is the universal recipient (can receive from any blood type). Type A can donate to A and AB. Type B can donate to B and AB. Type AB can only donate to AB. Type O can donate to all types. The Rh factor (+ or -) also matters; Rh- can donate to both Rh+ and Rh-, but Rh+ can only donate to Rh+."
        },
        "universal": {
          "question": "Why is O- called the universal donor?",
          "answer": "Type O negative blood is called the 'universal donor' because it lacks the A, B, and Rh antigens that could trigger an immune response in recipients. This means it can be safely transfused to patients of any blood type in emergency situations when there's no time to determine the recipient's blood type."
        },
        "components": {
          "question": "What are the main components of blood?",
          "answer": "Blood consists of four main components: 1) Red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body; 2) White blood cells, which fight infection; 3) Platelets, which help blood clot; and 4) Plasma, the liquid portion of blood that contains water, salts, and proteins. Each component can be separated and used for different medical treatments."
        },
        "shelfLife": {
          "question": "How long can donated blood be stored?",
          "answer": "The shelf life of donated blood components varies: Red blood cells can be stored for up to 42 days at 6°C. Platelets can only be stored for 5-7 days at room temperature with constant agitation. Plasma can be frozen and stored for up to one year. This is why regular blood donations are essential to maintain adequate supplies."
        }
      },
      "donation": {
        "eligible": {
          "question": "Who is eligible to donate blood?",
          "answer": "Generally, blood donors must be at least 17 years old (16 with parental consent in some areas), weigh at least 50 kg (110 lbs), and be in good health. Donors should not have certain medical conditions, recent tattoos or piercings, or have traveled to certain regions. Specific eligibility criteria may vary by country and blood collection organization."
        },
        "frequency": {
          "question": "How often can I donate blood?",
          "answer": "For whole blood donation, you can typically donate once every 8-12 weeks (56-84 days). For platelet donation (apheresis), you may be able to donate more frequently, up to 24 times per year with at least 7 days between donations. Plasma donors can donate more frequently, typically every 28 days. These intervals allow your body to replenish the donated components."
        },
        "process": {
          "question": "What happens during the blood donation process?",
          "answer": "The blood donation process typically takes 45-60 minutes total, with the actual blood collection taking only 8-10 minutes. The process includes: 1) Registration and identification verification; 2) Health history questionnaire and mini-physical (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and hemoglobin test); 3) The donation itself, where about 450-500 ml of blood is collected; and 4) Refreshments and a short rest period before leaving."
        },
        "preparation": {
          "question": "How should I prepare for blood donation?",
          "answer": "To prepare for blood donation: 1) Eat iron-rich foods in the weeks before donation; 2) Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before and after donation; 3) Get a good night's sleep; 4) Eat a healthy meal 2-3 hours before donating; 5) Avoid fatty foods before donation; 6) Wear comfortable clothing with sleeves that can be rolled up; and 7) Bring identification and a list of medications you're taking."
        },
        "after": {
          "question": "What should I do after donating blood?",
          "answer": "After donating blood: 1) Rest for at least 15 minutes and have a snack and drink provided at the donation center; 2) Increase fluid intake for the next 24-48 hours; 3) Avoid strenuous physical activity, heavy lifting, or vigorous exercise for 24 hours; 4) Don't smoke for at least 2 hours; 5) Keep the bandage on for several hours; 6) If you feel dizzy, lie down with your feet elevated; and 7) Contact the blood center if you develop any unusual symptoms."
        },
        "benefits": {
          "question": "Are there health benefits to donating blood?",
          "answer": "Yes, blood donation offers several potential health benefits: 1) Free health screening that can detect issues like high blood pressure; 2) Reduction in iron stores, which may lower the risk of heart disease; 3) Production of new blood cells, which may help your blood flow better; 4) Burning calories (about 650 calories per pint donated); and 5) Psychological benefits from helping others. However, blood donation should primarily be viewed as a way to help others rather than as a health intervention."
        }
      },
      "website": {
        "register": {
          "question": "How do I register as a blood donor on your platform?",
          "answer": "To register as a blood donor on our platform: 1) Create an account by clicking 'Sign Up' and providing your email and password; 2) Complete your profile with personal information, including your blood type and contact details; 3) Fill out the health questionnaire to determine your eligibility; 4) Verify your identity and contact information; 5) Set your donation preferences and availability; and 6) Accept the terms and conditions. Once registered, you can update your profile and respond to donation requests."
        },
        "request": {
          "question": "How do I request blood through your platform?",
          "answer": "To request blood through our platform: 1) Create an account or log in; 2) Click on 'Request Blood' in the main menu; 3) Fill out the request form with patient details, blood type needed, quantity, location, and urgency; 4) Upload any supporting documents (doctor's prescription or hospital admission details); 5) Submit your request for verification; 6) Once verified, your request will be visible to potential donors in your area; 7) You'll receive notifications when donors respond to your request; and 8) Coordinate with the donor or our team to complete the donation process."
        },
        "verify": {
          "question": "How does your platform verify blood requests?",
          "answer": "Our platform verifies blood requests through a multi-step process: 1) Document verification - we check medical documents, prescriptions, and hospital admission details; 2) Hospital confirmation - we may contact the hospital or medical facility to confirm the need; 3) Identity verification - we verify the identity of the requester through government ID and contact information; 4) Location verification - we confirm the location where blood is needed; and 5) Urgency assessment - we prioritize requests based on medical urgency. This process typically takes 1-4 hours depending on urgency and complexity."
        },
        "notifications": {
          "question": "How will I be notified about matching blood requests or donors?",
          "answer": "You'll receive notifications through multiple channels: 1) In-app notifications within our platform; 2) Email alerts sent to your registered email address; 3) SMS text messages for urgent matches (if you've opted in); 4) WhatsApp messages (if you've connected your account); and 5) Push notifications on your mobile device if you've installed our app. You can customize your notification preferences in your account settings to receive only the alerts that are most important to you."

          "answer": "We share your information only with: 1) Matched donors/recipients (only necessary contact information to facilitate donation); 2) Healthcare providers and blood banks involved in the donation process; 3) Service providers who help operate our platform (with strict confidentiality agreements); 4) Legal authorities when required by law; and 5) Emergency contacts you've designated.

          "answer": "To delete your account and data: 1) Log in to your account; 2) Go to 'Account Settings'; 3) Select 'Privacy & Data'; 4) Click on 'Delete My Account'; 5) Follow the verification process to confirm your identity; 6) Select which data you want to delete (you can choose to maintain donation records for medical purposes while deleting personal information); 7) Confirm deletion.

      "awareness": {
        "fraud": {
          "question": "What are common blood donation scams I should be aware of?",
          "answer": "Common blood donation scams include: 1) Fake emergency requests that create urgency to bypass verification; 2) Financial scams requesting payment for 'processing fees' or 'transportation'; 3) Identity theft schemes that collect excessive personal information; 4) Impersonation of hospitals or blood banks; 5) Fake blood donation drives that collect donations for non-existent patients; 6) Phishing attempts through fake blood donation websites or apps; and 7) Social media scams with emotional stories but no verifiable details. Always verify requests through official channels and never send money to unverified requesters."
        },
        "verify": {
          "question": "How can I verify if a blood request is legitimate?",
          "answer": "To verify a blood request's legitimacy: 1) Check if the request comes through our verified platform; 2) Look for hospital documentation with letterhead, doctor's name, and contact information; 3) Call the hospital directly using a number from their official website (not the one provided in the request); 4) Ask for specific details about the patient's condition and blood needs; 5) Be wary of requests that only provide mobile numbers or refuse hospital verification; 6) Check if the requester has a complete profile with verification badges; and 7) Report suspicious requests to our platform immediately."
        },
        "report": {
          "question": "How do I report suspicious activity or potential fraud?",
          "answer": "To report suspicious activity: 1) Use the 'Report' button on any request or profile page; 2) Select the type of suspicious activity from the dropdown menu; 3) Provide details about why you believe it's fraudulent; 4) Upload any evidence you have (screenshots, communications); 5) Submit the report for our team to investigate; 6) For urgent concerns, contact our support team directly through the 'Contact Us' page or emergency hotline; 7) You can also email evidence to our dedicated fraud prevention team at report@blooddonationcommunity.org. All reports are kept confidential and investigated promptly."
        },
        "community": {
          "question": "How does community awareness help prevent fraud?",
          "answer": "Community awareness prevents fraud through: 1) Collective vigilance where donors share information about suspicious patterns; 2) Education about common scams and red flags; 3) Peer verification where community members can vouch for legitimate requests; 4) Rapid reporting of suspicious activity; 5) Sharing of verified donation experiences; 6) Community-led awareness campaigns; and 7) Support networks that help connect people with verified donation channels. Our platform facilitates this community awareness through verified reviews, community forums, and educational resources."
